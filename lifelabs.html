  </div>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The leaves of the trees roared, happy chatterings were heard everywhere. The civilization talks about a very demure, mindful, lady who is the most beautiful in their civilization. That lady is the daughter of the Xianle kingdom, her father is the king, Xianle Guowang. His daughter’s name is named after the kingdom, Xie Lian. Despite being named after the kingdom, she and her father are not on good terms.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Not only her, 15% of the kingdom are also not on good terms with the King, mainly because of the 500 rules. The Xianle Kingdom is very strict with its rules, knights everywhere. The knights are as strict as the rules.</p>
   <img id="img" src="images/unnamed (1).png" alt="example image">
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian stormed out of the kingdom to take a break from his father’s nonsense. As soon as she stepped foot outside, the civilization put their attention on her. Yells and small shouts were calling for the princess, she paid no attention to it as she did not have time for it.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian arrived at Mt.Taicang after a few walks with deep thoughts, she looked around the place. Bushes around as leaves fall from trees to the surface, it was autumn season. a ruttle ruttle was heard from a certain bush, Xie Lian caught the bush, it was still rattling in its place.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">One thing about Xie Lian, she was brave. In the Xianle Kingdom, women were always believed to be weak and needed to be protected.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian takes a step closer to see what was in the bush. The atmosphere changes slightly, then-</p>
    <strong>
      <i>
        <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Poof!</p>
      </i>
    </strong>  
    <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">There comes out a man, who looked like a peasant based on the dirty ripped clothes. Xie Lian flinched a little and raised a brow, asking the man what he was doing there. The man looked at the princess and realized it was her excellency, he started apologizing for surprising her.</p>

        <img id="img2" src="images/unnamed (2).png" alt="example image">
         <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The princess told him it was no such big deal, the man sighed in relief and explained that he was searching for fruits to eat. Xie Lian pitied the man and gave him a XiaoLongBao, the man happily thanked her and ate it.</p>
         <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The man introduced himself as Hua Cheng, Xie Lian was shocked that this homeless man was from the Hua family.  Hua Cheng told him his parents didn’t accept him and threw him away in the streets, right after many tries of selling him but no rich individual or family wanted him.</p>
         <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The princess felt bad and empathized with his story, she remembered she had an old shrine for her to stay in if ever her and her father’s fight worsened.</p>
         <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian asked if he would like to stay at an old place she doesn’t really use, Hua Cheng eyes widened in excitement and quickly accepted the offer if her excellency didn’t mind.</p>
         <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">She, of course, did not mind at all. She guided Hua Cheng along the path as it’s just near Mt.Taicang.</p>
         <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">As soon as they arrived at her old shrine, Hua Cheng quickly made himself feel at home. Xie Lian never found a man so cute. As time passed by, Xie Lian and Hua Cheng surprisingly had a lot in common. They bonded throughout the afternoon, Xie Lian asked if he wanted to go around the town of Xianle as a guest of hers.</p>
         <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Hua Cheng happily  accepted the offer again.</p>
          <strong>

          </strong>
          <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The wind blew through with the sun’s light, Xie Lian sprinted across the town until the kingdom’s main gate. As she stopped at the main gate, she looked everywhere, hoping to see Hua Cheng. After a minute of still looking, Hua Cheng peeks from a tree. The princess wondered why he was hiding there, Hua Cheng was too shy to step into the Xianle kingdom.</p>
          <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian took his hand to pull him through the gate, the man couldn’t believe he was able to step into the kingdom again. They walked through the town and bought some needs and wants of Hua Cheng, despite all the gossip of the princess having a peasant with her, Xie Lian distracted Hua Cheng from hearing them.</p>
          <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Her excellency wanted to bring Hua Cheng inside Xianle’s, the thing is, Xianle Guowang would certainly not allow it. She instead made a plan to sneak him in, luckily, the king was taking a rest on his throne, peacefully snoring. Xie Lian sees this as an opportunity to sneak Hua Cheng in, as they took soft steps to avoid any noise.</p>

        <img id="img3" src="images/unnamed (3).png" alt="example image">
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian toured Hua Cheng around the castle, showing him every important belongings of the Xianle’s. Whether it was gold, diamonds, or anything. She trusted him even though they met in a little short time. Xie Lian described it as a path of the heart, instead of a feeling.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">After a few explanations of the collections, the princess has one final collection of the Xianle’s that was kept up over 800 years. It was the sword of the first king, Xianle Liu, of Xianle. No individual has ever got it out of its stone ever since Xianle Liu stabbed it hard onto the ground.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Hua Cheng couldn’t believe what he’s seeing, the sword of the first king right before his eyes. He didn’t want to lose Xie Lian’s trust in him, so the man carefully approached it as given permission from the princess.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian gave him permission to try and pull the sword out, already expecting that it won't come out. Hua Cheng still tried, the princess turned her back to him while explaining– Xie Lian got interrupted by a shing! sound. She turned to look at Hua Cheng, who had succeeded in pulling the sword out.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The princess was shocked, her eyes widened. Xie Lian was about to ask him how he did that when all of a sudden the place started shaking, that’s when it hitted her excellency. It was an alarm for the knights that a treasure had been moved, the man wondered what was happening.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian was about to tell Hua Cheng to hide but the knights had already barged in the room. They yelled for the man to return it, however, out of shockness, Hua Cheng broke a window and got himself out. He didn’t wanna do that, but he also didn’t wanna get caught by the guard.</p>
        
        <img id="img4" src="images/unnamed (4).png" alt="example image">
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">He knew it would lead Xie Lian to misunderstand, making it sound like he’s actually a thief or a traitor. Xie Lian didn’t and will never think of him like that, she knew deep down he just panicked.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The king entered the scene, seeing the sword gone. He got furious and looked at Xie Lian.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">They argued in the main hall, mostly yelling from the king. Xie Lian tried to explain everything to him but as usual, Xianle Guowang chose to make a foolish decision. He gathered knights to find the peasant, take the sword back, and behead the man once found.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian couldn’t let this happen. She tried to find Hua Cheng before they could. Unfortunately, after hours and hours of searching, she still couldn’t find him. He wasn’t at her old shrine as well. The princess started overthinking and panicking but she calmed herself in deep breaths.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">She goes back to the kingdom, more bad luck spawned right before her eyes. She came back to the kingdom all wrecked up and fired everywhere. Sword fighting was heard everywhere.</p>
   <img id="img5" src="images/unnamed (5).png" alt="example image">
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Looked to the side and saw her father stabbed dead on a golden pillar, it added more panic to the princess. Xie Lian ran inside the castle, she saw Hua Cheng. Filled with bruises and holding the sword of the first king, he's not destroying the kingdom, its self defense.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Xie Lian called for him, and the man turned to her. Hua Cheng was fighting the two strongest knights of Xianle. The knights saw this as an opportunity to attack, the princess called it out. Hua Cheng simply defended himself, their fight continued.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">...and continued.</p>
   <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Until three of them took a final blow, three of them died. Xie Lian was speechless, she dropped on her knees. She watched them as they both three slowly lost their lives. Xie Lian finally yelled, cried. Hua Cheng looked at her and mouthed <i>“Run away!”</i>, Xie Lian sniffing obediently, ran away from the kingdom with tears flowing from her eyes.</p>
   <strong>
      <i>
        <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">A few years later.</p>
      </i>
    </strong>
    <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">Sunlight made the festival more cheerful, it was lovely weather for the day. The crowd happily chattering and singing with each other, cheers suddenly filled the air as the queen, Xie Lian, of the Hua Lian Kingdom stepped outside to enjoy the peaceful town.</p>       
    <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; text-align: justify;">The queen happily communicated with the town, she laughed, danced, and sang with them. The kingdom had only 10 simple rules as she does not wanna be like her father, who made the previous kingdom strict.</p>
